Deployment Strategy
Blue Green Deployment
one is blue server, one will be green server
blue is running normally with 2.5v, all the users are using it.

green instance is idle. v2.5, update green and gradually move all users to green. now both the instances are live
and once everyone is moved, blue can go idle.
Maybe use it as recovery server if something goes wrong.
now if green environment is running smoothly, you can update blue instance v3.0.
And the process continuous.
both has the shared database.
